### Viewing `index.html` with Live Server in Visual Studio Code

To view your `index.html` in a web browser using the "Live Server" extension, follow these steps:

1. **Open with Live Server**:
   - Right-click on the `index.html` file in the Explorer pane.
   - Click on "Open with Live Server".

This will launch a local development server and automatically open your default web browser to display the `index.html` page. The "Live Server" provides live reloading functionality, which means it will automatically refresh the page in the browser whenever you save changes to the file.

### Installing Live Server

If the "Live Server" extension is not installed:

1. Go to the Extensions view by clicking the square icon on the left sidebar or by using the shortcut `Ctrl+Shift+X`.
2. Search for "Live Server".
3. Click "Install" on the "Live Server" extension.

### Alternative Method Without Live Server

If you prefer not to use "Live Server":

1. **Reveal in File Explorer**:
   - Right-click on the `index.html` file in Visual Studio Code.
   - Select "Reveal in File Explorer" (Windows) or "Reveal in Finder" (macOS).

2. **Open with a Web Browser**:
   - In the file manager, double-click on `index.html` to open it in your default web browser.
   - Or, right-click on the `index.html` file and choose "Open with", then select the web browser you wish to use.

3. **Refresh Manually**:
   - After making changes to your HTML file, refresh the browser manually to see updates.
   - Press `F5` or use the refresh button in your browser.

# Project Description

CampusFinder helps students find resources on campus by answering a simple set of questions!

### Problem Space

Yale and broader New Haven has numerous resources for all sorts of purposes and needs. Yet, these resources are often underutilized because they are difficult to find, or students simply do not know about them.

### Tasks

1. View available resources in New Haven

2. Obtain customized resources based on preferences

### Constraints

The tool must be used by only one student at a time, and their body (including raised arms) must be visible. Thus, we recommend users to stand a couple feet away to ensure the camera captures all the necessary points.
