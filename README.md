## Viewing `index.html` with Live Server in Visual Studio Code

To view your `index.html` in a web browser using the "Live Server" extension, follow these steps:

1. **Open with Live Server**:
   - Right-click on the `index.html` file in the Explorer pane.
   - Click on "Open with Live Server".

This will launch a local development server and automatically open your default web browser to display the `index.html` page. The "Live Server" provides live reloading functionality, which means it will automatically refresh the page in the browser whenever you save changes to the file.

### Installing Live Server

If the "Live Server" extension is not installed:

1. Go to the Extensions view by clicking the square icon on the left sidebar or by using the shortcut `Ctrl+Shift+X`.
2. Search for "Live Server".
3. Click "Install" on the "Live Server" extension.

### Alternative Method Without Live Server

If you prefer not to use "Live Server":

1. **Reveal in File Explorer**:
   - Right-click on the `index.html` file in Visual Studio Code.
   - Select "Reveal in File Explorer" (Windows) or "Reveal in Finder" (macOS).

2. **Open with a Web Browser**:
   - In the file manager, double-click on `index.html` to open it in your default web browser.
   - Or, right-click on the `index.html` file and choose "Open with", then select the web browser you wish to use.

3. **Refresh Manually**:
   - After making changes to your HTML file, refresh the browser manually to see updates.
   - Press `F5` or use the refresh button in your browser.
